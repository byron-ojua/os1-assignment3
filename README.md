# os1-assignment3
This is my repo for the smallsh OS1 assignment. I have included a Makefile to make your testing easy.

To automatically compile and start the program, just type 'make test' into the terminal.

If you only want to automatically compile, just type 'make' into the terminal.

To manuely compile and run, do the following:
    1) Type 'gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies_by_year main.c' in your terminal to compile
    2) Type ‘./movies_by_year’ into the terminal to run
